#Breast Cancer Classification Using Random Forest, SVM, and LSTM
This project focuses on building and evaluating three machine learning algorithms—Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a deep learning model (LSTM)—to classify breast cancer tumors as benign (0) or malignant (1) using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset.

A full pipeline was implemented including:

Data preprocessing
Standardization
Model training
10-fold stratified cross-validation
Manual computation of performance metrics
ROC & AUC analysis
Comparison across all algorithms

The goal is to understand which algorithm performs best and how model selection impacts classification performance in medical diagnosis tasks.
